# Projects
Below is a list of some of my projects which are publicly available.

## Cookieless Session Scanner
> <https://github.com/danielthatcher/Cookieless-Session-Scanner>

A small BurpSuite extensions which adds an active scanner check to test web servers for [ASP.NET Cookieless Sessions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/aa479315(v=msdn.10)). The extension also marks any cookiless sessions present in request paths as insertion points for Burp's scanner.

## glyphy
> <https://github.com/danielthatcher/glyphy>

A small tool written in Go which generates [homoglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph) from ASCII text. The tool mostly uses substitutions generated by testing Chrome and Firefox to see which unicode glyphs are converted to ASCII when passed to JavaScript's `URL` constructor, with the intention being that it is likely to generate homoglyphs which will be treated by some software as equivalent to the given ASCII text, and can therefore be used to bypass or trick filters.

## clips
> <https://github.com/danielthatcher/clips>

A command line based clipboard manager designed to be useful for when you find yourself typing the same command repeatedly in many different contexts, for example in reverse shells and web shells. You can globally set variables, such as your VPN IP address when connecting to a lab environment, which are then used in command generation.

## pgexec
> <https://github.com/Dionach/pgexec>

A script to automate the process of turning access to a PostgreSQL instance to command execution on the host. The script can load a custom library to be used in the process, but will also run in a fully self-contained manner, generating and compiling the library source as it is run.
