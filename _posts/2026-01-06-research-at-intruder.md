While working at Intruder, all of my research is published on their [research blog](https://www.intruder.io/research). Here are the projects I've worked on:

# Practical HTTP Header Smuggling: Sneaking Past Reverse Proxies to Attack AWS and Beyond
This is a research project covering a methodology to determine how headers can be modified to smuggle them through to back-end servers without the front-end processing them. This project was also presented at Black Hat Europe 2021 - you can watch the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAtpG6OYYNM).

# In GUID We Trust
A walk-through of exploiting a password reset functionality that used v1 GUIDs as tokens. This also included the release of a [tool](https://github.com/intruder-io/guidtool) for exploiting predictable GUIDs.

# Detecting Server-Side Prototype Pollution
A methodology for identifying and exploiting server-side prototype pollution vulnerabilities in Node.js applications in black-box scenarios.

# We Hacked Ourselves With DNS Rebinding
Part 1 of a 2-part series on DNS rebinding attacks, covering how I exploited a DNS rebinding vulnerabilities in Intruder's own portal to gain AWS access.

# Tricks for Reliable Split-Second DNS Rebinding in Chrome and Safari
Part 2 of the DNS rebinding series. In this post, I introduce new techniques for achieving reliable, split-second DNS rebinding in Chrome, Edge, and Safari when IPv6 is available, as well as a technique for bypassing the local network restrictions applied to the fetch API in Chromium-based browsers.
